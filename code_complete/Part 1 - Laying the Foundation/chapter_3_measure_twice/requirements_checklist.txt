Requirements Checklist

Specific Functional Requirements
- Are all inputs to the system specified, including their source,
    accuracy, range of values and frequency?
- Are all the outputs from the system specified including their 
    destination, accuracy, range of values, frequency and format?
- Are all output formats specified for Web pages, reports and so on?
- Are all the external hardware and software interfaces specified?
- Are all the external communication interfaces specified, including
    handshaking, error-checking, and communication protocols?
- Are all the tasks the user wants to perform specified?
- Is the data used in each task and the data resulting from each task
    specified?

Specific Nonfunctional (Quality) Requirements
- Is the expected response time, from the users point of view, specified
    for all necessary operations?
- Are other timing considerations specified, such as processing time, 
    datatransfer rate, and system throughput?
- Is the level of security specified?
- Is the reliability specified, including the consequences of software
    failure, the vital information that needs to be protected from
    failure, and the strategy for error detection and recovery?
- Are minimum machine memory and free disk space specified?
- Is the maintainability of the system specified, including its ability
    to adapt to changes in specific functionality, changes in the 
    operating environment, and changes in its interfaces with other
    software?
- Is the definition of success included? Of Failure?

Requirements Quality
- Are the requirements written in the users language? Do the users
    think so?
- Does each requrement avoid conflicts with other requirements?
- Are the acceptable tradeoffs between competing attributes specified - 
    for example, between robustness and correctness?
- Do the requirements avoid specifying the design?
- Are the requirements at a fairly consistent level of detail? Should
    any requirement be specified in more detail? Should any requirement
    be specified in less detail?
- Are the requirements clear enough to be turned over to an independent
    group for construction and still be understood? Do the developers 
    think so?
- Is each item relevant to the problem and its solution? Can each item
    be traced to its origin in the problem environment?

- Is each requirement testable? Will it be possible for independent
    testing to determing whether each requirement has been satisfied?
- Are all possible changes to the requirements specified? Including the
    likelihood of each change?

Requirements Completeness
- Where information isnt available before development begins, are the 
    areas of incompleteness specified?
- Are the requirements complete in the sense that if the product 
    satisfies every requirement, it will be acceptable?
- Are you comfortable with all the requirements? Have you eliminated
    requirements that are impossible to implement and included just to
    appease your customer or boss?
