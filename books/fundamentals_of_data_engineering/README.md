# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

"Success or failure is rarely a technology issue. Knowing how to navigate an organization, scope and gather requirements, control costs, and continuously learn are key descriminators."

## Data Engineering Lifecycle

- data generation
- storage
- ingestion
- transformation
- serving

## Part I. Foundation and Building Blocks

### [Chapter 1. Data Engineering Described](./1_1_DATA_ENGINEERING.md)

"Once a new technology roll sover you, if youre not part of the steamroller, youre part of the road"

### The Data Engineering Lifecycle

- generation
- storage
- ingestion
- transformation
- serving

Underpinned by (at all stages):

- security
- data management
- dataOps
- data architecture
- orchestration
- software engineering

### Simplified Data Maturity Model

- 1. Starting with data
- 2. Scaling with data
- 3. Leading with data
