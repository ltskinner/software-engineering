# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

"Success or failure is rarely a technology issue. Knowing how to navigate an organization, scope and gather requirements, control costs, and continuously learn are key descriminators."

## Data Engineering Lifecycle

- data generation
- storage
- ingestion
- transformation
- serving

## Part I. Foundation and Building Blocks

### [Chapter 1. Data Engineering Described](./1_1_DATA_ENGINEERING.md)

"Once a new technology rolls over you, if youre not part of the steamroller, youre part of the road"

"Business never sleeps"

"Companies dont hire engineers to simply hack code in isolation. To be worth of their title, engineers should develop a deep understanding of the problems theyre tasked with solving, the technology tools at their disposal, and the people they work with and serve"

#### Simplified Data Maturity Model

- 1. Starting with data
- 2. Scaling with data
- 3. Leading with data

### [Chapter 2. The Data Engineering Lifecycle](./1_2_DE_LIFECYCLE.md)

- Generation
- Ttorage
- Ingestion
- Transformation
- Serving

#### Underpinned by (at all stages)

- Security
- Data management
- DataOps
- Data architecture
- Orchestration
- Software engineering

Also, use DAGs to document and orchustrate
