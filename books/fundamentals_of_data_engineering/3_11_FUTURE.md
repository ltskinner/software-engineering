# Chapter 11. The Future of Data Engineering

## The Data Engineering Lifecycle Isnt Going Away

## The Decline of Complexity and the Rise of Easy-to-Use Data Tools

The intersection of red-hot competition in the data-tooling space with a growing number of data engineers means data tools will continue decreasing in complexity while adding even more functionality and features

## The Cloud-Scale Data OS and Improved Interoperability

Predict that data engineering will gradually coalesce around a handful of data interoperability standards

- Objects in the cloud will grow in importance as a batch interface layer between various data services
  - cloud data interchange
- IaC tools will take on a bigger role

## "Enterprisey" Data Engineering

Good (structured processes) handling of things:

- management
- operations
- governance
- other boring stuff

Allows a shift of focus to:

- easy of use
- interoperability
- other refinements

## Titles and Responsibilities Will Morph

Basically MLOps reaching all the way to data source

Expect that ML engineers will become more specialized to work on model types that are closer to research and less well understood

Software engineers gotta upskill too

## Moving Beyond the Modern Data Stack, Toward the Live Data Stack

Modern (current) shit is still built around the data warehouse paradigm, they just live in the cloud now

### The Live Data Stack

- fuse real time analytics and ML into applications by using streaming technology
- covers full data lifecycle from application source systems to data processing to ML and back

### Streaming Pipelines and Real-Time Analytical Databases

Moving away from the batch paradigm - unbounded processing

`Stream, Transform, Load (STL)`

### The Fusion of Data with Applications

### Tight Feedback Between Applications and ML

In theory, the tightening of these data feedback loops should compound

### Dark matter Data and the Rise of ... Spreadsheets?!

At its heart, a spreadhseet is an interactive data application that supports complex data analytics
