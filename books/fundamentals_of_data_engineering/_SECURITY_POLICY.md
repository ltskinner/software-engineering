# Example Security Policy

## Protect Your Credentials

Protect your credentials at all costs. Here are some ground rules for credentials:

- Use SSO for everything. Avoid passwords whenever possible, and use SSO as the default
- Use multifactor authentication with SSO
- Dont share passwords or credentials. This includes client passwords and credentials. If in doubt, see the person you report to. If that person is in doubt, keep digging until you find and answer
- Beware of phishing and scam calls. Dont ever give your passwords out (again, prioritize SSO)
- Disable or delete old credentials. Preferably the latter
- Dont put your credentials in code. Handle secrets as configuration and never commit them to version control. Use a secrets manager where possible
- Always exercise the principle of least privilege. Never give more access than is required to do the job. This applies to all credentials and pricileges in the cloud and on premises

## Protect Your Devices

- Use device management for all devices used by employees. If an employee leaves the company or your device gets lost, the device can be remotely wiped
- Use multifactor authentication for all devices
- Sign in to your device using your company email credentials
- All policies covering credentials and behavior apply to your device
- Treat your device as an extension of yourself. Dont let your assigned device out of your sight
- When starting screen sharing, be aware of exactly whay youre sharing to protect sensitive information and communications. Share only single documents, browser tabs, or windows, and avoid sharing your full desktop. Share only whats required to convey your point
- Use "do not disturb" mode when on video calls; this prevents messages from appearing during calls or recordings

## Software Update Policy

- Restart your web browser when you see an update alert
- Run minor OS updates on company and personal devices
- The company will identify critical major OS updates and provide guidance
- Dont use the beta version of an OS
- Wait a week or two for new major OS version releases
