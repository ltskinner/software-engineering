# Chapter 13. Epilogue

## Where to Go from Here?

### Graph Algorithms

Trypically require analyzing the entire graphs structure

Two main concepts:

- Graph algs typically require global computation across most if not all the graph
- Some algs can be broken into localized computations, some cannot

### Distributed Graphs

Graphs need to be distributed when they are too large to reasonably fit on a single machine

### Graph Theory

Certain classes of graphs, like planar graphs

### Network Theory

Studies natural graphs, or graph structures that occur in the real world around us and within different disciplines

- biological
