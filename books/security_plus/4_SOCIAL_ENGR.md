# Chapter 4. Social Engineering and Password Attacks

## Social Engineering and Human Vectors

Social Engineering: practice of manipulating people through a variety of strategies to accomplish desired actions

Key principles:

- Authority
  - people follow people with authority
- Intimidation
- Consensus-based
- Scarcity
- Familiarity-based
- Trust
- Urgency

### Social Engineering Techniques

- Phishing
  - smishing (sms)
  - vishing (telephone)
  - spear fishing - targetting specific individuals in an org
  - whaling - c suite
- Vishing
  - phone calls to get targets to disclose personal, financial, other info
- Smishing
  - click link in text message
- Misinformation and Disinformation

TRUST process to counter mis and dis information:

- 1. Tell your story
- 2. Ready your team
- 3. Understand and assess MDM
- 4. Strategize reponse
- 5. Track outcomes

More SE techniques:

- Impersonation
- Business Email Compromises (BEC)
  - relies on using apparently legitimate email addresses to conduct scams
  - using compromised accounts
  - sending spoofed emails
  - using common fake but similar domain techniques
  - using malware or other tools
- Pretexting
  - process of using a made up scenario to justify why you are approaching an individual
- Watering hole attacks
  - use websites that targets frequent to attack them
- Brand Impersonation
  - pretend to be from a legitimate brand
  - try to get users to log into existing accounts
- Typosquatting
  - misspelled and slightly off urls, etc
  - pharming - relies on changing a systems hosts file (which is the first reference a system checks when looking up DNS entries)

## Password Attacks

- Brute-force attacks
  - iterate through passwords until they find one that works
- Password spraying
  - form of brute force
  - attempts to use a single password (or small set) against many accounts
- Dictionary attacks
  - form of brute force
  - lists of words for attempts

## Exam Essentials

- Many techniques are used for social engineering
- Passwords can be acquired and cracked in many ways
