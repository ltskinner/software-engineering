# Chapter 2. Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

## Exploring Cybersecurity Threats

### Classifying Cybersecurity Threats

- Internal vs External
- Level of Sophistication/Capability
- Resources/Funding
- Intent/Motivation

#### The Hats Hackers Wear

- Authorized hackers (white hat)
- Unauthorized (black hat)
- Semi-authorized (grey)

### Threat Actors

- Unskilled Attackers
  - script kiddies
  - plentiful and unfocused
- Hacktivists
  - Use hacking to accomplish some activist goal
  - Highly skilled hacktivists pose a significant danger to their targets
- Organized Crime
  - common thread is motive and intent: illegal financial gain
- Nation-State
  - Attack governments and companies
  - aka Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
    - advanced tech
    - persistent - attack over long period of time
  - zErO-dAy aTtAcKs
- Insider Threat
  - Employee, contractor, vendor, anyone with authorized access
- Competitors
  - Corporate espionage and theft
  - Engage in purchasing of data off darkweb

#### The Threat of Shadow IT

Situation where individuals and groups seek out their own technological solutions, like using dropbox or whatever to transfer files between work and personal machines (not always with malicious intent)

### Attacker Motivations

- Data exfiltration
  - Customer data, IP
- Espionage
  - General theft
- Service disription
- Blackmail
  - extortion or concessions
- Financial gain
- Philosophicala/political belief
- Ethical attacks
  - white hat pen testing
- Revenge
  - To embarass
  - Retribution/retaliation
- Disruption/chaos
- War

### Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

- Attack surface
  - System, application, service that has a vulnurability
- Threat vector
  - means that actors use to obtain access

Threat Vectors:

- Message-Based Threat Vectors
  - Phishing: email, sms, im, voice
- Wired Networks
  - Physical entry of public areas of building
  - Connecting to unsecured networks on wall
  - Find unlocked computer or w/e
- Wireless Networks
  - Wifi, bluetoot
- Systems (endpoints)
- Files and Images
- Removable Devices
  - USBs, etc
- Cloud
- Supply Chain
  - Like, the components and devices that a company rolls up into their own product

## Threat Data and Intelligence

Threat Intelligence: the set of activities and resources available to cyber professionals seeking to learn about changes in the threat environment

Vulnurability databases: good to have for orgs

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

### Oopen Source Intelligence

Now the challenge is deciding which sources to use

- senki.org
- ATT Open Threat Exchange
- MISP Threat Sharing
- threatfeeds.io

Government:

- cisa.gov AIS program (automated indicator sharing)
- dc3.mil

Vendors:

- microsoft
- cisco

Public

- isc.cans.org
- virusshare.com
- spamhaus.org

#### Exploring the Dark Web

Dark web is a network run over standard Internet connections using multiple layers of encryption

### Proprietary and Closed-Source Intelligence

Orgs doin or buying their own intel

### Assessing Threat Intelligence

- 1. Is it timely
- 2. Is the information accurate?
- 3. Is the information relevant?

Many threat feeds will include a confidence rating 0-100

### Threat Indicator Management and Exchange

- STIX
  - Structured Threat Information eXpression
  - XML
- TAXII
  - Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information

### Information Sharing Organizations

## Exam Essentials

- Threat actors differ in several key attributes
- Threat actors come from many different sources
- Attackers have varying motivations for their attacks
- Attackers exploit different vectors to gain initial access to an organization
- Threat intelligence provides organizations with valuable insight into the threat landscape
- Security teams must monitor for supply chain risks
