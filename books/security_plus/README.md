# Security+ Study Guide

A note for the casual observer: fucking piece of shit CompTIA expired my original cert and i have to take the whole ass test over again so one fucking jpg on my linkedin profile, and 17 characters on my resume are legit.

## Test Specs

- 90 min test
- up to 90 questions
- scored form 100-900
  - passing score: 750

CompTIA is notorious for including vague questions on all of its exams. Use your knowledge, logic, and intuition to choose the best answer and move on

CompTIA frequently does what is called *item seeding* which is the practice of including unscored questions on exams. It does so to gather psychometric data, which is then used when developing new versions of the exam.
