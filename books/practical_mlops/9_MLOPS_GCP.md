# Chapter 9. MLOps for GCP

## GCP Overview

Cons:

- fewer practicioners
- part of "surveillance capitalism" - "sv and other corps mining users information to predict and shape behavior"
- google has reputation for:
  - poor user and customer experience
  - frequently abandons products (like hangouts and plus)
  - so, if gcp continues to be the third-best optoin, will they discontinue it?

Pros:

- good at creating things that work at "planet scale"
