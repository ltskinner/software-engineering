# Chapter 5. AutoML and KaizenML

- Rules without Ideas is prison
- Ideas without Rules is chaos
- Bonsai teaches us balance
- Balancing rules against innovation is a pervasive problem in all of life

## AutoML

Once the conversation about automating a task begins, then eventually, the automation occurs

### Self-Handicapping strategies

Two classes: real and feigned

- "Real" self-handicapping involves placing visible obstacles to success in ones own path
  - The obstacles make one less likely to succeed, but they provide a ready excuse for failure
  - The student who neglects to study before an exam, or the aspiring actor who drinks before an audition are good examples
  - Sometimes failure is all but guaranteed, but at leas one will not be thought to be lacking in the relevant ability (or so it is hoped)
- "Feigned" self-handicapping, on the other hand, is in certain respects, a less risky strategy, on in which the person merely claims that there were difficult obstacles in the path to success.
  - This kind of self-handicapping consists simply of making excuses for possible bad performance, either before or after the fact

When data science initiatives fail, it is easy to dive into either of these self-handicapping strategies

- An example of this in data science could be by not using AutoML when it could help with certain aspects of a project

"Difficulty, or lack therof, doe snot equate with completeness or realness"

"MLOps: you dont need to build it to use it"

If you cannot put your model into production, you continue to do research cause what else are you gonna do?

"If I had 4 hours to train a model and put it into production, I would write as little code as possible", with a followup question of "Why am I writing *any* code?"

### MLOps Industrial Revolution

- Data science is a behavior
- AutoML is a technique

Think of it like *cruise control*

### Feature Stores

## Apples Ecosystem

"Where do you build a Burger King? Next to McDonalds" - you dont need to spend money to research where to expand because the top competitor has already done the work.

## Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

- Why is AutomML only part of the automation story with modern ML?
- How could the NIH (national institute of health) use a Feature Store to increase the speed of medical discoveries
- By 2025, what parts of ML will be fully automated and what aspects will not? By 2035, what parts of ML will be fully automated and what factors will not?
- How could vertically integrated AI platforms (chips, frameworks, data, and more) give particular companies a competitive advantage?
- How does the chess software industry provide insights into how AI and humans work together for improved outcomes in solving problems for AutoML?
- How does a data-centric approach differ from a model-centric approach to ML? How about a KaizenML approach where data, software, and modeling are all treated as equally important?
